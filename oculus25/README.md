# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Placeholders Everywhere
A simple redux demo has been implemented, check the landing page and the sponsors page, the used redux last year to save the state of the  navbar and the background (idk why)
entire structure is similar to oculus24
the Layout component iv used to wrap the main content in app.jsx, pretty redundant, modify/remove it if needed
go through the package.json
most of the code is gpt generated
